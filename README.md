# Introduction
Through this analysis, we expect the research to explore how the evolving technological landscape and global economic shifts are influencing the demand for foreign labor in specific sectors, as well as identifying the types of skills that are becoming increasingly critical in the U.S. workforce.Additionally, understanding how education levels and work experience correlate with the success rate of applications will provide insights into the skills and qualifications that employers prioritize most. Moreover, comparing wages across industries and occupations will help determine adequate salary levels and the demand for specific job roles. It will also include an analysis of the geographical distribution of these applications, revealing which states or regions are more likely to attract foreign workers.

The world is changing at a fast pace due to technological advancements, which impact current industry transitions and the skills necessary for employment. Adapting to these changes and keeping up with the times is essential in todayâ€™s world. Based on this, we have set our sights on analyzing PERM data. The PERM (Program Electronic Review Management) system, issued by the Department of Labor (DOL), allows an employer to sponsor foreign workers for U.S. permanent residency. The DOL must certify to the USCIS that there are insufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to accept the job offered to the foreign worker. In this research, we will analyze a wide range of data from PERM applications, including occupations, industries, geographical locations, salary ranges, and educational qualifications of applicants. By analyzing these data points, the study will highlight key trends in the U.S. labor market, such as which industries and job types have the highest demand for foreign workers.
