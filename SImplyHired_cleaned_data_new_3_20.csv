We partner with primary care providers to improve the engagement and management of their Medicaid patients, providing independent practices access to specialized resources and clinical programs to address medical, social and behavioral patient needs. Our care ecosystem is equipped with enhanced technology and data interfaces to enable provider and patient success in a value-based environment. Guided by our core values of humility, continuous learning and feeling the weight, our team is on a mission to strengthen communities from within, unlocking people's ability to live their healthiest lives.
We are looking for a Healthcare Data Scientist to join our team! This is a highly critical role on our growing team, who will help pioneer and grow healthcare analytic capabilities as we work to improve care for the disadvantaged. This role reports directly to the Senior Vice President, Technology.

Who We Are:

Diverge Health supports primary care practices to extend their reach and better serve patients on Medicaid. We bring providers significant infrastructure - contracts, local community health teams, provider liaisons, enabling technology and data – to improve outcomes for low-income patients, and enable success in value-based contracts.

Our technology organization is a small, growing team of problem solvers committed to improving healthcare outcomes for key disadvantaged populations. Our fully remote, entrepreneurial workforce strives to be…

Innovative – We love creative problem solvers capable of outside the box solutioning, and who work hard to find simple solutions to hard problems.
Independent – We take ownership of problems and have pride in our solutions, while working independently and supporting each other's efforts.
Adaptive – As a small team, we all lean in across the breadth of our technologies and love to learn new technologies and dive into new areas - and to figure things out as we go.


What We Do:

We create and execute our technology enablement efforts – from software development to data/analytics, to infrastructure, and enterprise technologies. We work collaboratively across internal stakeholders to understand business problems and needs, and design & implement solutions that support our mission of providing effective and transformative patient-centered care.

Our data science team leverages integrations with all types of healthcare data - claims data, electronic health/medical records, healthcare information exchanges, continuity of care information, admit/discharge records, etc. – to help identify patients that would benefit most from focused care efforts, and uses data to help shape the plans that offer care to this population. We leverage census and other population data to locate where such populations exist and are centered so that services can be effectively offered to large populations. We work to continually shape and improve healthcare so that it becomes both more effective and more cost-effective by analyzing clinical results and feeding that into future strategies.


We leverage a collection of cloud-based tools to store, analyze, and report within our data efforts. Our team members leverage:

Snowflake to store vast SQL databases – defining data models through DBT and integrations through Hightouch or Dagster.
The reporting capabilities of Sigma, Salesforce, or more to visualize results.
Advanced databases of AWS such as Dynamo for NoSQL or Neptune for relational queries.
The cloud for complex AI calculations with Jupyter notebooks in Sagemaker or other machine learning platforms.


How You Can Help Us:

Here are some key areas where we're looking to make our team stronger:

Knowledge of healthcare ecosystems, information & analytics – having knowledge of the data sources, types, nomenclature, used in healthcare is critical - in particular having a strong history understanding and analyzing claims data. This kind of knowledge often comes with 4-10 years of experience in healthcare but can also be demonstrated with other strong HCLS accomplishments. We're expecting this role to help address such problems such as market analyses, risk stratification, operational efficiency, clinical efficacy and healthcare quality metrics. We'd love to hear what you've done in similar areas, and where you're looking to grow.
Extracting and communicating information from data – a proven ability to communicate results by designing and creating dashboards and reports in systems such as Salesforce and BI tools like Sigma is important – you'll have to help people understand what our data is telling them in simple and effective ways.
Advanced SQL, analytics, and statistical background – someone who can understand the math and help navigate alternative statistical strategies. Having projects where you've investigated alternative data sources and approaches, and discussing how you helped guide teams to a successful decision and results, is a great way to demonstrate the ability to go deep.
Adaptable willingness and ability to support the team and achieve results – someone who has shown themselves willing to jump into new areas, learn new technologies, and do so quickly in a way that impacts the business. Being able to discuss examples of having a measurable impact on the business and mastering new technologies would show how you are focused on making a difference for the team and the company.
Keeping things simple – someone who remains focused on simple, reliable solutions even when the problems seem complex. We'd love to hear precedents where you took something really complicated and were able solve it with something simple, or in a way that addressed an even bigger problem in a general, flexible way.

And as potential bonus areas, we're also interested to hear about your

More in-depth previous experience in healthcare or with healthcare informatics/analytics, demonstrating in-depth knowledge of healthcare industry and terminology. A strong experience with medical and prescription claims information is important.
Breadth of data skills across the board with knowledge of infrastructures (in Snowflake, AWS), data modeling, reporting & visualizations, statistics/analytics, AI/ML, Jupyter notesbooks, etc. – we're still a small team and being able to demonstrate breadth of knowledge is as important as demonstrating depth.
A demonstrated ability to impact care quality and quality gaps – showing you can help quantify care quality or measure HEDIS/STARS metrics is a great benefit
History of automating data, analytics, and AI/ML pipelines to improve developer reliability, speed, and quality.

About the job

Google is an AI first company and is leading the efforts in principled AI adoption. We deeply care about the quality of the machine learning data and models used in production. Towards this goal, we are directly supporting the Gemini team and other Product Areas. Our mission is to improve the quality of models that Google releases through its various product offerings by providing tools and services for making faster and easier to reach model quality goals.
AI in the Gemini Era is profoundly data-centric: the “quality” of the data used for training, fine-tuning, or RAG, matters more to the performance of the end product than almost anything else. Where it becomes interesting is when we ask ourselves what “quality” means exactly and also what is the value of some specific data. It is very complex, model and use-case dependent, and the techniques that approximate it the best are often found on the frontiers of research.
Our mission is to dramatically improve the time to model quality for our users. We do so by bringing Data Optimization techniques to a broad audience through integrated tools and platforms. We build and iterate on tools to automatically and efficiently apply state of the art data optimization techniques. We demonstrate to our users which ones work best for their use case, and deliver insights on how to improve further. We’re working with key product teams across Google.
The US base salary range for this full-time position is $166,000-$244,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Our salary ranges are determined by role, level, and location. Within the range, individual pay is determined by work location and additional factors, including job-related skills, experience, and relevant education or training. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your preferred location during the hiring process.
Please note that the compensation details listed in US role postings reflect the base salary only, and do not include bonus, equity, or benefits. Learn more aboutbenefits at Google.

Do you want to join a brand-new team building an AI system that would disrupt the industry? Do you enjoy dealing with ambiguity and working on hard problems in a fast-paced environment?

Amazon Connect is a highly disruptive cloud-based contact center that enables businesses to deliver engaging, dynamic, and personal customer service experiences. With Amazon Connect, you can create your own cloud-based contact center and be taking calls in minutes. Amazon Connect leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence and the large ecosystem of AWS services such as Lex, Polly, Lambda, S3, and Kinesis to provide a truly frustration free and natural customer experience. With this technology, we are transforming an industry and the way customers interact with businesses and how agents service them.

As a Data Scientist on our team, you will analyze data from massive data sets to categorize customer idiosyncrasies, identify outliers, and systematically detect anomalies that substantially affect the performance of our models. You will work closely with other senior technical leaders within the team and across AWS. You should know how to trace decisions in data from raw data through complex models to their impact business metrics. Experience with machine learning explainability is a plus.

https://aws.amazon.com/connect/

Key job responsibilities
Categorizing Customer Idiosyncrasies: As we expand to more customers, we are discovering that they use our product in very different ways and that poses issues for our models. Effectively summarizing these differences (for example, X% of customers do Y) would be immensely helpful.

Detecting and Cleaning Up Outliers: We have situations where outliers have a huge impact on model outputs. You will help us develop mechanisms to clean up outliers for downstream consumption.

Deep Diving Customer Issues: Customers have longstanding traditions and trusted formulas for managing their contact centers. When our formulas differ from theirs, we need to deep dive these discrepancies and determine if there is an issue with our model or if we are giving the customer better results than they are used to.

Assessing Data Gaps: It's hard to estimate the weather in Seattle if the only data you have is the average weight of elephants in Zimbabwe. We know we don't have all the data we need, but we need to answer two related questions: (a) what features can we derive in creative ways from existing data sources? (b) can we estimate the benefit of getting a new data stream in terms of accuracy improvement?

A day in the life
Our team uses agile project management, so the DS calls in to our daily stand-up meeting in the morning to report status and explain their tasks for the day. Throughout the day, the DS will work with our product manager to discuss outstanding issues with our customers that require deep dives, work with our scientists to discuss model performance issues, and discuss software deliverables with our SDEs such as automation of data ingestion to save DS time, deployment of models, etc.

About the team
Our team is called Eliza and it was founded in 2019 to expedite science adoption in Connect. We are a team of scientists and engineers working on multiple science projects for Amazon Connect. Our team members work closely together to explore different approaches that can simplify management of contact centers and delight our customers and we move fast to implement solutions and refine them based on customer feedback.

The Technology Community Office is in search of a Senior Engineer - Generative AI to expand the team and our ability to deliver positive community experiences to developers at American Express.

Who are the Technology Community Office (TCO)

The mission of the Technology Community Office is to ensure American Express is positioned as a first-class technology company with a peerless engineering culture. This sees the office encouraging and curating participation in communities both internal and external fostering a sense of belonging among technologists. The office believes strongly in the power of community, not only unlocking the aggregate benefits of collaboration at scale, but the individual benefits that come from being part of a larger whole.

Some of the work of the TCO includes fostering innovation, encouraging participation in open-source communities, helping internal Engineering Guilds flourish, sponsoring community efforts such as conferences, foundations, and software organizations, empowering developers though documentation and content, reaching out to external technologists as ambassadors of American Express, building recognition programs, and gathering community sentiment feedback.

You understand the power of recognition and frequently dole out authentic praise. Colleagues do better work and enjoy doing it on a team with you.

You lead without authority – You’re not afraid to sit at the head of the table, and rarely remember your official title. You produce content that is consumed widely, your ideas are discussed and adopted at increasing orbits of influence. You enjoy speaking to large groups and lending your voice in group settings. People have changed the way they think and do work because they spent time with you. Others look to you for understanding and advice.

You are professionally curious – You bring clarity to the confusing and you thrive on exploration. You seek data to drive your decisions and are ready to learn. You have expertise but it does not constrain you, willing to put forth your best efforts as a “polymath”. You seek alternate perspectives and use them to make connections that others have overlooked.

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.

Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we're creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.

As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward's mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.

Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo's products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

The Roku Culture

Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.

We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Introduction to role
In 2025 within just the United States, over 2 million people are projected to be diagnosed with cancer. Along with heart disease, cancer is the leading cause of death across all ages. Cancer patients’ remaining lives are often measured in months, not years. How can we extend the recent advances in ML and AI to tackle cancer? How do we determine which patients should receive which drugs, especially if the drugs are still being developed? Will the drugs be safe? How much or how often should a drug be taken? What combination of drugs should be used?

The Red Alpha Data Science practice grew out of Red Alpha's reputation in Software and System Engineering with our Department of Defense clients. As sometimes happens, customers who trust our expertise in adjacent areas asked Red Alpha to assist with some of their burgeoning Data Science problems.
Culturally, it probably suffices to say that we take our work seriously, but not ourselves. Our leaders have spent time in the trenches and have cursed daylight savings time changes and trailing whitespace as many times as you have. We like to say that we spend 80% of our time cleaning the data...and 20% of our time complaining about cleaning the data. Joking aside, our voices matter, and it is easy to see how our decisions affect the Data Science practice and Red Alpha as a whole. We have a clear vision of where we are headed.
Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf. Did we mention we’re pragmatic? We have a diverse set of skills across our team, and whether you are a traditional Data Scientist (whatever that means…), an Applied Research Mathematician, a Database Engineer, a Full Stack Developer, or something else in that neighborhood, if you have a knack for picking apart data to make sense of it, we would enjoy having a conversation with you.

A day in the life:
We're looking for a talented Data Scientist to support a program which leverages Natural Language Processing for analysis. As part of a dynamic team of Data Scientists, Developers and Cloud Architects, you will have the opportunity to develop many prototypes, test proof-of-concepts, and have the unique freedom to bring forth your own original ideas in direct support and alignment of specific customer needs and enterprise tradecraft. Development will be performed in an Open-Source environment where you will have direct access to the commercial cloud, tools, libraries and other necessary resources for the software development process.

What you bring to the table:
Now on to the fun of formal requirements - we have to apologize in advance for the corporate-speak here, but just hold your breath for a few lines and everything will be okay. We are actively hiring data professionals for roles across a broad range of skill levels and projects. Our goal is to find the best fit for you so please note that if you apply to one of them and we see a fit elsewhere we will let you know. So do not worry about applying initially for every position you might be interested in.
All of our data scientists need the following skills:
Proficiency with a scripting language such as R or Python
Experience with data science techniques and algorithms such as classification, clustering, random forests, deterministic forests (jk), hierarchical modeling, deep learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and others. Note that you do not need to have all of these (we hope you enjoyed our random smattering of techniques…!) but you should be comfortable and capable with several of them and know some others not on this list.
A B.S. Degree in Data Science, Mathematics, Computer Science or related field.
For entry-level data scientists, 0-3 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For mid-level data scientists, 3-6 years of experience on Data Science projects.
For senior-level data scientists, at least 6 years of experience on Data Science projects with at least 3 years of experience managing teams.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn't work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we've embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We're building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

The Role

We are looking for experienced Data scientists to join Square's growing Banking organization. Square Loans has revolutionized the way businesses obtain the funding needed to achieve their goals. Unlike traditional business financing products, Square Loans are extended to pre-qualified sellers. If approved after a short application, sellers receive their funds as soon as the next business day, and repayment happens as a fixed percentage of daily card sales. As Square Loans expands its product features to help sellers meet their varying financing needs, you will leverage data solutions to shape and execute strategies that expand credit eligibility, enhance loan gross profit, and improve cohesive user experience with Square Banking products.

You Will
Establish subject-matter expertise in Loans architecture from underwriting policy to loan loss recovery strategy and lead decision making and drive alignments across multiple job functions.
Influence product roadmap and guide Square Loans team to navigate through product opportunities and problem ambiguities.
Collaborate with Product, Engineers, Credit Policy, and Operations teams to launch experimental loan products and find opportunities to improve loan origination, loss recovery and compliance risk mitigation.
Define goal metrics for measuring lending products success and set benchmarks for product optimization.
Expand your influence in Block Data Science community by developing and evangelizing data solutions to improve analytics insightfulness and actionability.
You Have
8+ years of data science, credit risk analytics, underwriting or related fields.
Wide-ranging experience working on ambiguous problems of high business impact and resolving complex issues in innovative and efficient ways.
Expertise in product growth, understanding and tracking user behavior using analytical lenses like engagement, conversion, cohorts, segmentation and funnel analysis.
Efficiently prioritizes concurrent projects and can deliver quickly during critical moments especially for product launch, without compromising quality.
Ability to build strong relationships with cross-functional stakeholders, clearly communicating findings and influencing product designs.
Advanced proficiency with data, analytics, and visualization technologies (we use SQL, Looker, and Python).

Even better:

Experience in business lending, business credit card, credit risk, underwriting is a huge plus.

Throughout our history, START has provided hope to cancer patients in global community practices by offering access to cutting edge trials throughout the US and Europe. Today, with over 1,300 studies completed, and with research facilities in the United States and in Spain, Portugal, and Ireland, START’s mission is to accelerate the development of new anticancer drugs that will improve the quality of life and survival for patients with cancer and lead to its eventual cure. To date, over 43 therapies conducted at START locations have obtained FDA/EMA approval. Incredibly, while Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) conduct 80% of cancer trials, such trials reach only 20% of the patient population – leaving the majority of patients who are treated in community practices and hospitals without access to a clinical trial when their care journey calls for one. START serves the many – by bringing cancer trials to physicians and their patients in community hospitals and practices when hope is needed most.

START represents the world’s largest roster of Principal Investigators (PIs) across its eight clinical trial sites. Committed to accelerating passage from trials to treatments, START delivers hope to patients, families, and physicians around the world. As an example, in San Antonio, where START was founded, START treated the first patient ever with Keytruda – the most effective cancer drug in medical history.
